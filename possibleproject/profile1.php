					<p>Level One student Joandy is the owner of FixKicks, a sneaker refurbishing and repair business.  Joandy, a charming sophomore at Cambridge Rindge & Latin School, has quickly proven to be one of our most dedicated students, coming to TPP to work on his business nearly every day, even when his group isn't in session!  His unique sense of style was a major inspiration when he was contemplating what type of venture to launch, and he tells his customers that he "knows the importance of making sure your shoes are always fresh."  Joandy has used the money he earned from the Level One Pitch Panel to purchase equipment to repair broken soles and retouch the paint on faded or cracked sneakers.  In two months, he had eight customers and his friendly attitude and commitment to high quality will undoubtedly earn him many more.  Joandy plans to join Level Two during the summer 2013 trimester so that he can play on the CRLS boys' volleyball team during the spring season.  However, even during this trimester off, he still plans to attend TPP's drop-in business hours so that he can continue to "fix the world, one sneaker at a time."</p>
