					<p>Something Belle, a handmade accessories venture, is taking The Possible Project by storm. Founders Chardé and Janika are seniors at the Community Charter School of Cambridge who dreamed up their business as a way to bring individuality to their school’s dress code. They produce headbands, hair bows, and bowties in a wide variety of fabrics and sizes for an affordable price. Something Belle is a very customer-service oriented business and will look for fabrics to meet any request. Chardé and Janika believe in giving back to their community and a portion of Something Belle’s sales go to support SASS, a student group that works to empower girls.  TPP is so proud of all these two have accomplished- as of February 2013 we know Janika will be attending Hamilton College on a full scholarship through the POSSE Foundation and we are waiting to hear what lucky four-year college will be able to count Chardé as a member of its Class of 2017.</p>
