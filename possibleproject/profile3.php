					<p>Eli Tamalia Pins is a custom pin design and manufacturing business. This venture was launched in fall 2011 by students Tameisha and Elizabeth, two students from Community Charter School of Cambridge. Tameisha is currently a Level Four student (as of February 2013) and has assumed sole control of the business. EliTamalia Pins targets teenagers, corporations, school clubs, and event committees who want a creative and inexpensive way to promote their organizations or showcase their interests. Past customers have included the Babson Marketing Case Competition, The Possible Project, and administrators at the Community Charter School of Cambridge. Tameisha completed her Level Three Pitch Panel in January 2013 and had an extraordinary presentation - this once shy and quiet teen has come into her own as a public speaker, resilient entrepreneur, and self-confident student.</p>
