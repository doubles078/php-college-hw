					<p>The Go 2 Guys are a repair, refurbishing, and customization service for personal electronics such as iPhones, iPods, and game consoles. Founded by students Carlos and Skyeler in July 2012, The Go 2 Guys have grown their business at an incredible rate and are impressing customers with their know-how and professionalism. If your iPhone screen is cracked- call The Go 2 Guys and Carlos can repair it at a fraction of the price that you would be charged anywhere else. If your Xbox console looks boring and you want to dazzle it up, Skyeler can customize it with orginal art based upon your specifications. Carlos and Skyeler started at The Possible Project in May 2012 with TPP's first Level One group from Prospect Hill Academy. Now in their sophomore year of high school, Carlos (still at Prospect Hill Academy) and Skyeler (now at Cambridge Rindge & Latin School) have completed Level Two programming and began Level Three in February 2013.
